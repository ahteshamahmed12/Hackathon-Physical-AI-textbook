### Response

```text
I have created `AI_Book/docs/module-3-isaac.md` and `AI_Book/docs/module-4-vla.md` with comprehensive content, including subsections, subheadings, and relevant code examples for Isaac Sim and Visual Language Models (VLA) for Robotics, respectively. I've also updated `AI_Book/sidebars.ts` to include these new modules. All modified files have been added to the staging area.
