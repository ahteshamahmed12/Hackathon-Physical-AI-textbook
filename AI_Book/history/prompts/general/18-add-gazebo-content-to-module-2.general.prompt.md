### Prompt

```text
sp.tasks please add all the content related to gazebo in module 2 with sub section and sub heading also add code where necessary and include all content related to gazebo
```

### Response

```text
I have added comprehensive content about Gazebo to `AI_Book/docs/module-2-gazebo.md`, including subsections, subheadings, and relevant code examples. The content covers an introduction to Gazebo, version comparison (Classic vs. Sim), installation, robot description formats, ROS 2 integration, a simulation example, and advanced topics. The updated file has been added to the staging area.
