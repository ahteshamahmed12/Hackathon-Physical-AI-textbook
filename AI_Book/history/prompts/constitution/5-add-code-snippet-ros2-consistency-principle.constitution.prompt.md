## Prompt

```text
All code snippets must be marked with the correct language (e.g., python` or bash). ROS 2 code should use the rclpy` (Python) framework for consistency.
```

## Response

The project constitution has been updated to version 0.3.0 with a new principle: "Code Snippet and ROS 2 Framework Consistency". This principle mandates correct language marking for code snippets and consistent use of the `rclpy` (Python) framework for ROS 2 code.
