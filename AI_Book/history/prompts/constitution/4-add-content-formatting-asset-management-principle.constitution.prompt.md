## Prompt

```text
All chapter files must be MDX (.md or .mdx). All static assets (images, diagrams) must be stored in static/img and referenced with correct Docusaurus paths.
```

## Response

The project constitution has been updated to version 0.2.0 with a new principle: "Content Formatting and Asset Management". This principle mandates the use of MDX for chapter files and specifies the storage and referencing of static assets within the Docusaurus project.
