## Prompt

```text
The project's primary theme color MUST be #007ACC (A professional blue), set via the --ifm-color-primary CSS variable.
```

## Response

The project constitution has been updated to version 0.4.0 with a new principle: "Primary Theme Color". This principle mandates the use of `#007ACC` as the primary theme color, set via the `--ifm-color-primary` CSS variable, to ensure a consistent and professional visual identity.
