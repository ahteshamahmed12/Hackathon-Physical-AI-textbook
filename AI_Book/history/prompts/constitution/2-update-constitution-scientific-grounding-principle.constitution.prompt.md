## Prompt

```text
All claims, definitions, and technical explanations must be grounded in peer-reviewed scientific literature. The content must reflect the latest research in Embodied AI, Robotics, and Cognitive Science.
```

## Response

The project constitution has been updated to version 0.1.0 with a new principle: "Scientific Grounding and Currency". This principle ensures that all claims, definitions, and technical explanations are grounded in peer-reviewed scientific literature and reflect the latest research in Embodied AI, Robotics, and Cognitive Science.
