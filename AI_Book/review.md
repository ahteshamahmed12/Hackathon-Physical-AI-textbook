I have implemented the following changes to adjust the layout of the search bar and button in the RAG chatbot:

1.  The `flexDirection` of the `inputContainer` in `src/components/ChatWidget.js` has been changed to `column`.
2.  `marginBottom: '8px'` has been added to the `input` style within `src/components/ChatWidget.js` to create spacing between the input field and the send button.

**Please clear your browser cache thoroughly before checking the chatbot.** This is crucial to ensure the new styles are loaded correctly.

After clearing your cache, please check the page where the RAG chatbot is displayed and let me know:

1.  If the search bar and button are now positioned from top to bottom as requested.
2.  If the text and background issues (blurry/opaque text) have been resolved from previous attempts.

Your detailed feedback is essential for confirming these changes and the overall resolution of the issues.
